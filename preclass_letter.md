Hello GDI'ers!

I'm excited to see you all [date] for some awesome build tools goodness, but before that, here are a few handy reminders!

**Bring:**

- Your computer
- Charger
- Yourself!

**Pre-prep:**

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. [Instructions are here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Please make sure your version of Node is > 6 (the current long-term stable version is 6.10.2). If you are running an older version of Node, consider running [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple Node versions. You should also have a text editor on your laptop, such as Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
